# chrome-extension: qr-code-popup

My first chrome plugin popup page.

This plugin is just an exercise, it will not be published.

This plugin will add an icon to the browser. When te user click on the icon a plugin popup will show QR-code of the URL. If the URL is complex (including hash and query-string) every button will show the appropriate qr-code.

# chrome-extension: qr-code-popup

My first chrome plugin popup page.

This plugin is just an exercise, it will not be published.

This plugin will add an icon to the browser. When the user clicks on the icon, a plugin popup will show the QR-code of the URL. If the URL is complex (including hash and/or query-string), the plugin popup will show several buttons and every button will show the correspondent qr-code.

## How to use it:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the `yarn` or the `npm install` command
3. Run the `yarn build`, this command will create the plugin into the `dist` folder.
4. When you have to load the unpacked code you should select the `dist` folder into the project.
